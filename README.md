## EXCHANGE

Simple Exchanger made with React - Typescript - React Hooks - [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) Jest - [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query)
I used Grommet as UI library because provides accessibility, modularity, responsiveness, and theming in a tidy package.
